                <p>I have been programming since I was 10 (4 years ago)<br>I started with small basic and scratch, but scratch was too basic and boring for me so I asked my uncle (who is a professional programmer) and he introduced me php.<br>But unfortunately I didn't find it interesting so I researched and finally found python.<br>Then I started learning it professionally for more than two years; Now, I'm here! developing websites and learning html, css, javascript, flask and so much more! Some of my small projects can be found in my <a href="https://www.github.com/behrad26/">Github account</a>.<br>I also won the second place in the Khwarazmi Youth Festival for a full translator created by python.</p>
